      <h2>White Space</h2>
      <h4>Udemy</h4>

      <p>
        I chose Udemy for an example of white space because they did an excellent 
      job with not overloading you with pictures or information, especially on the 
      mobile viewer. This makes the important headlines and information easier to 
      understand and draws attention to what really matters on the site.

      <h4>Jaybird</h4>

      <p>
        I chose Jaybird because of their simple recommended actions. On the first 
        part of their homepage, they simply provided one action- shop now. Instead 
        of giving a bunch of different options, they gave us one option that is 
        almost guaranteed to have what we're looking for.

      <h2>Repetition</h2>
      <h4>Seahawks</h4>
      <a href="https://www.seahawks.com">seahawks.com</a>
      <img src="images/IMG_4697.jpg" alt="a screenshot of seahawks.com taken from a mobile web browser" />
      <hr />
      <p>
        I chose Seahawks because when I visited the website, I immediately saw the 
        team's logo plastered all over. For a sports team, the logo is important as 
        a recognizable link so that even the casual sports fans can be aware of the 
        team. All over the website and on every item on the page, every single thing 
        had the seahawks logo. Even the displays of the fan merchandise they sell 
        has the logo and team name all over it.
